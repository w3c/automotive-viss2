title: "VISSv2 Feeder"
---

A feeder is a Sw component that needs to implement three tasks:
* Implement an interface to the data storage
* Implement an interface to the underlying vehicle interface
* Translate data from the format used in the "VSS domain" to te format used in the "Vehicle domain".

The SW architecture shown in figure 1 reflects the division of the three tasks in that the translation (map & scale) is done in the min process,
which spawns two threads that implement the respective interface task.
The architecture shown handle all its communication with the server via the state storage.
This leads to a polling paradigm and thus a potential latency and performance weakness.
This architecture is therefore not found on the master branch, but available on the datastore-poll branch.

An improved architecture that eliminates the mentioned weaknesses for data flowing in the direction from the server to the feeder (i. e client write requests)
is shown in figure 2. For write requests the server communicates directly over an IPC channel with the feeder, thus removing the need for the feeder to poll
the state storage to find new write requests.

A feeder implementing the optimized polling version of the SwA is found at the master branch.
This feeder can be configured to either use an SQLite, or a Redis state storage interface, please see the Datastore chapter for details.

A design for how the polling on the server side can be mitigated is in the planning stage.
It is likely to require an update of the feeder interface.

The feeder translation task is divided into a mapping of the signal name, and a possible scaling of the value.
The instructions for how to do this is encoded into one or more configuration files that the feeder reads at startup.
There are two versions of the feeder instructions, being used in template feederv1 and feederv2, respectively.

In version 1 this file only contains a signal name mapping, while version 2 supports also scaling instructions.
For more about the telpate feeders, see the README in [feeder-template](https://github.com/w3c/automotive-viss2/tree/master/feeder/feeder-template) directory.

An OEM wanting to deploy the VISSv2 tech stack needs to implement the Vehicle interface of the feeder, e. g. to implement a CAN bus interface.
In the template feeders the Vehicle interface contains a minimal signal simulator that generates random values for the signals it is configured to support.
All  of that code should be removed and replaced by the code implementing the new interface client.

Besides the feeder templates there is also an [rl-feeder](https://github.com/w3c/automotive-viss2/tree/master/feeder/feeder-rl)
where the Vehicle interface is implemented to connect to a RemotiveLabs broker.
[RemotiveLabs](https://remotivelabs.com/) has a public cloud version of its broker that can be used to replay trip data available in VSS format.

There is also an External Vehicle Interface Client [EVIC](https://github.com/w3c/automotive-viss2/tree/master/feeder/feeder-evic)
feeder that enables the interface client to be implemented in a separate executable.
